# Jarvis-AI
Hello my name is Sergei and i have a youtube channel called Tech Set Studios! I have been working on a python AI named after jarvis from iron man! I so far have used the nltk module as a way of spliting up the words so jarvis can figure out what the sentence means by word. I made some tutorials before on a text based jarvis which was hard coded and didn't learn at all! The old jarvis would only respond correctly if you wrote the keyword sentence correctly. This was dumb becuase if you mispronounces somthing he would not understand! With the new AI he will try to see what the closest match is and if he's not sure he will ask for reasurance! I'm hoping to get developers and programers that know more about nltk to follow me and help out on the this project so it can become a reality!

I will have to add a few sections of code that will deal with telling if the sentence is a statment, question, compliment, order, humor, complaint or other etc. As well as one that deals with keywords that are good and bad to tell what is going on and if action on the AIs part must be taken. I will then have a list of actions that it can take and cammands that it knows like for example: what's the weather like or where are we! I need to also find a decent speech recognition module so when i set this up on my raspberry pi which is how i am going to make it portable. It will be able to tell what i am saying with at-least 80% acuracy! This is the NLTK module tutorial series from sentdex: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDf2JswnfiGkliBInZnIC4HL

"So far jarvis just listens to you, and when you say somthing he prints any question keywords in the sentece. And can almost 100% tell if somthing you say is a question or not! Pretty basic but it's a work in progress!"
