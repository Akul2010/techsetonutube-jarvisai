# Jarvis-AI
Hello my name is Sergei and I have a youtube channel called Tech Set Studios! I have been working on a python AI named after jarvis from iron man! I so far have used the Natural Language Proccessing module, NLTK as a way of spliting up the words so jarvis can figure out what the sentence means by word. I made some tutorials before on a text based jarvis which was hard coded and didn't learn at all! The old jarvis would only respond correctly if you wrote the keyword sentence correctly. This was dumb becuase if you mispronounces somthing he would not understand! With the new AI he will try to see what the closest match is and if he's not sure he will ask for reasurance! I'm hoping to get developers and programers that know more about nltk and other important topics like Speech to text or Artifical inteligence to follow me and help out on the this project so it can become a reality!

We have been adding a few sections of code that will deal with telling if the sentence is a: Statment, Question, Compliment, Order, Humor/Sarcastic remark, Complaint, Command, Etc. As well as one that deals with keywords that are good and bad to tell what is going on and if action on the AIs part must be taken. I will then have a list of actions that it can take and cammands that it knows like for example: "what's the weather like" or "where are we". I also need to find a decent speech recognition module so when I set this up on my raspberry pi which is how i am going to make it portable. It will be able to tell what i am saying with at-least 90% acuracy! Jarvis, right now is almost able to tell if somthing is a question or a greeting we are working on getting him to know what the input is: Question, Greeting, Command, etc. 

If you would like to join our team of coders working on jarvis (Not a paying job, more like a group of coders working together to finish a cool project.) Now that project is jarvis but after jarvis we will hopfully work on other things. If you are interested send me an email and @Richard Aspden and I will evaluate if you are right for our team. If not maybe you will be called for our next project. So Anyone with deep understanding in: Python3, Python, Artifical Inteligence, Natural Language Proccessing, Machine Learning, Speech To Text, Text To Speech; please email me at sergei.glimis@gmail.com. Oh and our platform is in Python 3 so you need to be great in python3 and be able to use your speciality i.e: AI, TTS, NLP. in python3.
